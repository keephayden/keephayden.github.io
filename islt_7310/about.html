        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Jordan Hayden. I was born and raised in Saint Charles, Missouri. I live there now as well. I am majoring in Information Technology and minoring in Business at the <strong>University of Missouri</strong>. I have taken a web development course in the past and have some background knowledge over HTML5 and CSS3. The expectation I have for this course is understanding both the front and back end of things better.
        <br/>
        With the new skills learned through this course I hope to be able to understand how to security works within the development of websites. I hope to do cyber security in the future so getting a better idea on both ends of development, I will be able to understand how to secure it. I also enjoy spending some of my time doing any physical activity, whether it is a sport or exercise in some way. Staying active is something I hope to carry with me through the rest of my life.</p>
