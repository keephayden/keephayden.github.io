                <h2>How it has been for me...</h2>
                <br>
                <div id="firstP">When I came to the University of Missouri to study Information Technology, I was completely new to everything that was introduced to me. At one point I was unsure if this is what I wanted to continue doing. I was only interested from the beginning because it seemed like something that is a good tool to learn. As time continued to move forward everything started to come together, and I was able to feel a sense of certainty with this major.</div>
                <br><br>
                <div class="P">What drew my attention toward this career path was cyber security. Growing up and hearing as well as seeing what hackers are capable of really gave me the idea to strive for this career. I do not know if cyber security is the route I want to go into since IT is very broad and has many directions to decide however it is still high up on my list.</div>
                <br><br>
                <div class="P">Throughout this program I have gained a good relationship with the field and all it has to offer. I can learn things I have always wanted to learn but never had an opportunity. I have taken another Web Development course and that class happened to be my turn around for I barely had any experience with coding a website. From that class I was able to understand so much more within other parts of IT and especially programming.</div>
                <br><br>
                <div class="P">Overall, this field of study is something I am happy to be doing and I am grateful to have the opportunity to learn. My goals moving forward are to find the right fit for myself in the IT field and be able to further my education along the way. I believe this can and will be done and I cannot wait to continue to learn more with this class and others to come.</div>
